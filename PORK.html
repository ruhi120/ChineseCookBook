						<b>Ingredients:</b><br>
						Streaky pork<br>(pork belly) with rind, 500 g<br>Bay leaves<br>cinnamon<br>cooking wine<br>garlic<br>ginger slices<br>salt<br>soy sauce<br>star anise<br>sugar<br><i>Note: the reddish color of this dish is mainly from sugar; soy sauce is just used to season, and too much soy sauce will give the dish a darker color. If you want to give the dish a brighter color, you can use rock candy, instead of sugar. The amount of the seasonings should be adjusted to suit one's personal taste.<br></i>
						<img src="0521165927.jpg" height="200" width="275" border="5" color="Chocolate"> </img>
						<b>Preparation:</b><br> 
						Clean the pork with water. Then cut it into 2.5 cm cubes (about 1 inch) and put them onto a plate. Each piece of pork should contain both fat and lean meat. You may cut them into larger pieces if you prefer.<br>
						<b>Methods:</b><br> 
						Step 1: Place a wok over high heat until it gets hot. Add some cooking oil. When the oil is hot add the pork. Stir-fry the pork cubes until their surface is brown.<br>
						<i>Stir-fry the Pork</i><br>
						Step 2: Push the pork to one side of the wok and leave the oil in the center. Add some sugar or rock candy and stir it until the syrup bubbles and turns brown. Then mix the pork and the syrup to color the pork cubes.<br>
						<i>Fry the Sugar to Color the Pork</i><br>
						Step 3: Add the seasonings in turn: 4- 5 pieces of bay leaves, 2 -3 pieces of cinnamon, 2 spoons of cooking wine, 5 slices of ginger, one spoon of soy sauce, 7 - 8 pieces of star anise, and some salt (according to personal taste). Stir-fry them and add enough boiled water to just cover all of the pork cubes.<br>
						<i>Add Seasonings and Water</i><br>
						Step 4: Bring to a boil and then turn down the heat and cover the wok. Stew the pork for about 1 hour. The meat will taste better if you take it out of the wok and stew it in an earthen pot.<br>
						<i>Simmer the Meat over Low Heat</i><br>
						Step 5: Add some garlic. You can also add potato or carrot and stew them for another 30 minutes. Then put the meat back to the wok and cook over high heat until all liquids are absorbed.<br>
						<i>Add Vegetables</i>

						Chinese name:(táng cù li ji)<br>
						Style: Zhejiang Cuisine<br>
						Characteristics: it is reddish in color, sweet and just a little sour, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.<br><br>
						One of the well-known dishes in the Zhejiang Cuisine, this dish is popular among all the people regardless of age or gender. Everyone loves its special taste of sweet mixed with sour, its freshness, its crisp outside and its tender inside. Its raw materials are simple and making it is not difficult, either. However, you need a few tips to cook it well. First, the key to a crisp outside and a tender inside is that the lean pork strips must be fried twice. Second, the proportion of salt to white sugar is critical. It must be perfected over time according to one’s personal taste. Third, when stir-frying the cutlet in the sauce mix, the movement must be quick.
